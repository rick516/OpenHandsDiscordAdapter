# OpenHandsDiscordAdapter System

## Project Overview
The OpenHandsDiscordAdapter System is designed to connect Discord users with the OpenHands AI coding assistant. This integration allows users to interact with OpenHands directly from Discord, enabling seamless coding assistance within communication channels.

## Core Requirements

1. **Discord Bot Interface**
   - Provide a command-based interface for interacting with OpenHands
   - Support natural language conversations in designated channels
   - Display task results and status updates in a user-friendly format

2. **OpenHands Integration**
   - Connect to the OpenHands CLI to execute coding tasks
   - Manage user sessions and task queues
   - Handle asynchronous task execution

3. **Task Management**
   - Create and track coding tasks
   - Provide status updates on ongoing tasks
   - List all tasks for a specific user

4. **Conversation Support**
   - Enable natural language conversations with OpenHands
   - Maintain conversation context for each user
   - Support both direct messages and designated channels

## Project Scope
This project focuses on creating a robust and user-friendly bridge between Discord and OpenHands. It does not modify the core OpenHands functionality but rather provides an accessible interface through Discord.

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully create and manage coding tasks through Discord
- The system handles multiple concurrent users and tasks
- Task results are properly formatted and displayed in Discord
- Conversations with OpenHands feel natural and maintain context
- The system is reliable and handles errors gracefully
