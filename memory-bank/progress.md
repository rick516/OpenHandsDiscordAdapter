# Progress

## What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Discord bot setup and connection
- ✅ Command handling (`!oh task`, `!oh status`, `!oh help`)
- ✅ Slash command support (`/task`, `/status`, `/help`, `/tasks`)
- ✅ OpenHands CLI integration
- ✅ Response formatting for Discord

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ⚠️ Docker build in CI/CD (issue with uppercase repository name)
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Type annotations and static type checking

### Documentation & Testing
- ✅ System architecture documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Test infrastructure setup
- ✅ Unit tests for Formatter (basic functionality)
- ✅ Internationalization support (Japanese README)

## What Needs Improvement

### Immediate Priorities
- ⚠️ Fix Docker repository name to use lowercase in CI/CD workflow
- ⚠️ Enhance PR title validation with more detailed rules
- ⚠️ Improve error handling for OpenHands CLI failures
- ⚠️ Add more unit tests for core components

### Future Improvements
- ⚠️ Add interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns)
- ⚠️ Implement caching for frequently used data
- ⚠️ Add input validation and permission checks
- ⚠️ Expand internationalization support

## Current Status
The system is functional with both traditional prefix commands and modern slash commands implemented. Users can create tasks, check task status, and have conversations with OpenHands through Discord. Documentation is available in both English and Japanese.

Currently, there is an issue with the Docker build in the CI/CD pipeline due to the use of uppercase letters in the repository name (`OpenHandsDiscordAdapter:test`), which violates Docker's requirement for lowercase repository names. This needs to be fixed in the GitHub Actions workflow.

We also need to enhance the PR title validation to enforce the conventional commit format more strictly.

## Known Issues
1. Docker build fails in CI/CD due to uppercase repository name
2. PR title validation needs more detailed rules
3. Limited error handling for OpenHands CLI failures
4. Insufficient test coverage

## Current Milestone: CI/CD and Docker Improvements
- ⚠️ Fix Docker repository name in CI/CD workflow
- ⚠️ Enhance PR title validation
- ⚠️ Ensure consistency between local and CI/CD environments
