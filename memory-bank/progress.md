# Progress

## What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Discord bot setup and connection
- ✅ Command handling (`!oh task`, `!oh status`, `!oh help`)
- ✅ Slash command support (`/task`, `/status`, `/help`, `/tasks`)
- ✅ Conversation handling in DMs and designated channels
- ✅ OpenHands CLI integration
- ✅ Task queue management
- ✅ Response formatting for Discord

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Environment variable handling
- ✅ Basic error handling

### Planning & Documentation
- ✅ System architecture documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialization
- ✅ Design review and gap analysis
- ✅ Unit testing strategy development
- ✅ Internationalization support (Japanese README)

## What Needs Improvement

### Error Handling
- ⚠️ More robust error handling for OpenHands CLI failures
- ⚠️ Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- ⚠️ Better error messages for users

### User Experience
- ⚠️ Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- ⚠️ Interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns)
- ⚠️ Better formatting for code snippets

### Performance
- ⚠️ Optimization of task queue management
- ⚠️ Caching for frequently used data
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring and logging

### Security
- ⚠️ Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- ⚠️ Permission management for command execution
- ⚠️ Rate limiting to prevent excessive requests

### Internationalization
- ⚠️ Localization of bot messages and responses
- ⚠️ Language selection options for users
- ⚠️ Support for additional languages

## What Needs to Be Built

### Extended Functionality
- ❌ File upload/download capabilities
- ❌ Workspace management commands
- ❌ Project management features
- ❌ Team collaboration features

### Documentation
- ❌ Comprehensive user guide
- ❌ API documentation
- ❌ Deployment guide

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for core components
- ❌ Integration tests for component interactions
- ❌ End-to-end tests for full system flow
- ❌ Load testing

### Monitoring & Diagnostics
- ❌ Health checks for system components
- ❌ Metrics collection for performance indicators
- ❌ Alert mechanisms for system issues
- ❌ Diagnostic commands for troubleshooting

## Current Status
The system is functional with both traditional prefix commands and modern slash commands implemented. Users can create tasks, check task status, and have conversations with OpenHands through Discord. Documentation is available in both English and Japanese. The core architecture is solid and follows good design principles. A comprehensive design review has identified several areas for improvement, and a unit testing strategy has been developed to ensure code quality.

## Known Issues
1. Long-running tasks may timeout without proper feedback
2. Large responses may be truncated due to Discord's message size limits
3. No authentication or permission system for commands
4. Limited error handling for OpenHands CLI failures
5. No test coverage to ensure code quality and prevent regressions
6. Missing monitoring capabilities for system health
