# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on fixing a Docker build error in the CI/CD pipeline and improving PR title validation. 

### Docker Build Error
The error occurs because the Docker repository name contains uppercase letters, which is not allowed by Docker:
```
ERROR: invalid tag "OpenHandsDiscordAdapter:test": repository name must be lowercase
```

This error is occurring in the GitHub Actions workflow when attempting to build the Docker image with the tag `OpenHandsDiscordAdapter:test`. Docker requires repository names to be lowercase.

### PR Title Validation
We need to enhance the PR title validation to enforce the conventional commit format more strictly:
- Ensure proper format: `type(scope): description`
- Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Description must be present and start with lowercase letter

## Recent Changes
- Identified Docker build error in CI/CD pipeline related to uppercase repository name
- Enhanced PR title validation in CI workflow
- Fixed all mypy type annotation issues across the codebase
- Fixed formatter tests
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- Implemented Discord slash commands
- Created Japanese README (README_ja.md)
- Added CI/CD workflow and code quality tools

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Docker Build Error**:
   - Update the GitHub Actions workflow to use lowercase repository name
   - Ensure consistency between docker-compose.yml and CI/CD configuration

2. **Enhance PR Title Validation**:
   - Add more detailed validation rules
   - Provide better error messages with examples

3. **Continue Implementing Unit Testing Framework**:
   - Implement more unit tests for core components
   - Increase test coverage

4. **Address Design Gaps**:
   - Enhance error handling with retry mechanisms
   - Implement security measures
   - Add performance optimizations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Docker Configuration
- Docker repository names must be lowercase
- Need to ensure consistency between local development and CI/CD environments

### CI/CD Decisions
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Implement linting, testing, security checks, and Docker image build tests
- Set up branch protection rules
- Use GitHub Flow for branching strategy
- Enforce conventional commit format for PR titles
