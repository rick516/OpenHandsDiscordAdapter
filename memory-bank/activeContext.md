# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on enhancing the OpenHandsDiscordAdapter system with modern Discord features and internationalization support. Previous focus was on analyzing the system and implementing testing capabilities. The system now has the following components:

1. Discord Bot (`src/bot/bot.py`) with slash command support
2. OpenHands Adapter (`src/adapter/openhands_adapter.py`)
3. Response Formatter (`src/utils/formatter.py`)
4. Configuration Management (`src/config.py`)
5. Documentation in English and Japanese

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of Discord slash commands (`/help`, `/task`, `/status`, `/tasks`)
- Creation of Japanese README (README_ja.md) for internationalization
- Updated help formatter to include slash command information
- Updated README to document both slash commands and prefix commands
- Improved LLM provider configuration documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Unit Testing Framework**:
   - Set up test directory structure with `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, etc.
   - Install necessary testing packages (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-mock`)
   - Create test fixtures for mocking external dependencies
   - Implement unit tests for core components (Formatter, Adapter, Bot)

2. **Address Design Gaps**:
   - Enhance error handling with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
   - Implement security measures (input validation, permission checks, rate limiting)
   - Add performance optimizations (caching, pagination, async processing)
   - Develop monitoring and diagnostics capabilities
   - Expand internationalization support to system messages

3. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement more robust error handling for OpenHands CLI failures
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient errors
   - Improve error messages for better user experience

4. **Extend Command Set**:
   - Add commands for managing workspaces
   - Implement file upload/download capabilities
   - Add support for project management commands

5. **Improve User Experience**:
   - Add interactive buttons for common actions
   - Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Enhance formatting of code snippets in Discord

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize task queue management
   - Implement caching for frequently used data
   - Add monitoring and logging for performance metrics

7. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Complete system documentation
   - Implement planned unit and integration tests
   - Create user guides for Discord commands

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Testing Strategy
- Use `pytest` as the primary testing framework
- Implement `pytest-asyncio` for testing async code
- Use `unittest.mock` and `pytest-mock` for mocking dependencies
- Create separate test cases for each component
- Implement integration tests for component interactions

### Architecture Decisions
- Maintain the current modular architecture
- Keep the separation between Discord bot and OpenHands adapter
- Continue using asyncio for asynchronous processing
- Enhance with additional error handling and security layers

### Technical Decisions
- Updated to support Discord.py's slash commands
- Continue using subprocess for OpenHands CLI execution
- Maintain Docker-based deployment
- Add testing dependencies to development environment

### UX Decisions
- Support both slash commands and prefix commands for backward compatibility
- Focus on improving response formatting
- Enhance progress reporting for long-running tasks
- Consider adding interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns)

### Security Considerations
- Ensure proper handling of API keys
- Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper permission checks for commands 
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Internationalization
- Added Japanese README as first step toward internationalization
- Plan to extend internationalization to system messages and responses
- Consider adding language selection command
